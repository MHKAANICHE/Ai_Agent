Let’s structure this vision into actionable phases, using the "Librarian-Architect" framework. I’ll outline the conceptual workflow and components, organized to evolve your existing system step-by-step.

---

### **Phase 1: Install the Librarian (Memory Core)**
**Objective**: Create a **context-aware conversation memory** system that understands relationships between discussions and project artifacts.

#### **Components**:
1. **Interaction Ledger**  
   - *What*: MongoDB collection storing every user-AI exchange with metadata:  
     ```plaintext
     {
       timestamp: "2024-03-15T14:30",
       type: "code_change",
       context_tags: ["#database", "#schema"],
       summary: "Switched user schema to include OAuth2 providers",
       linked_files: ["src/domain/user.ts", "infra/auth/adapter.ts"]
     }
     ```
   - *Why*: Enables temporal and contextual recall.

2. **Context Tagger**  
   - *What*: Auto-labels interactions with topics (e.g., `#auth`, `#testing`, `#ddd`).  
   - *How*: Use Gemini to analyze conversation snippets.  
   - *Example*:  
     *User says “Let’s add JWT auth” → Tags: `#security`, `#auth`*

3. **Rolling Summarizer**  
   - *What*: Condenses older conversations into:  
     - **Project Decisions**: *"Authentication: JWT chosen over sessions on 3/15"*  
     - **Architectural Edits**: *"Hexagonal layer 'infra/auth/' created for OAuth"*  
   - *Why*: Avoids token limits while preserving key context.

---

### **Phase 2: Introduce the Architect Professor (Governance Core)**
**Objective**: Embed architectural rules and patterns as **guardrails**, not constraints.

#### **Components**:
1. **Pattern Playbook** (Stored in MongoDB)  
   - *Content*:  
     ```plaintext
     Hexagonal Rules:
     - Core domain MUST NOT import framework code
     - Adapters MUST implement port interfaces
     
     TDD Rules:
     - New features require failing test first
     - 80% test coverage enforced
     ```
   - *Enforcement*: AI cross-checks code changes against these rules.

2. **Domain Model Tracker**  
   - *What*: MongoDB document mapping DDD constructs:  
     ```plaintext
     {
       aggregate: "User",
       bounded_context: "Identity",
       value_objects: ["Email", "PasswordHash"],
       linked_bdd: "features/auth.feature#L12"
     }
     ```
   - *Usage*: Prevents domain logic leakage into wrong layers.

3. **Architectural Linter**  
   - *Workflow*:  
     1. User: *"Add Stripe payment"*  
     2. AI:  
        - *Checks Playbook*: "Payment must be in 'core/payment' with adapters"  
        - *Proposes Structure*:  
          ```plaintext
          1. core/payment/ (Ports)
          2. infra/payment/stripe-adapter.ts
          3. Update dependency injection config
          ```

---

### **Phase 3: Design Interaction Protocols**
**Objective**: Balance user creativity with system rigor through **guided workflows**.

#### **Components**:
1. **Pacing Gatekeeper**  
   - *Rule*: Complex tasks are split into AI-guided steps.  
   - *Example*:  
     *User*: “Build a social media feed!”  
     *AI*:  
     ```plaintext
     Let’s approach this in Hexagonal layers:
     1. Domain: Define `Feed` aggregate (DDD)
     2. Infrastructure: Data sources (DB, APIs)
     3. UI: React components
     Where would you like to start?
     ```

2. **Technical Debt Ledger**  
   - *What*: Tracks shortcuts needing future refactoring.  
   - *Example Entry*:  
     ```plaintext
     Debt #45: Used direct DB call in UI layer (temp fix)
     Impact: Violates Hexagonal
     Scheduled Fix: 2024-04-01
     ```

3. **Contextual Help Modes**  
   - **Explorer Mode**: "Just prototype!" → Relaxed rules, rapid iteration.  
   - **Architect Mode**: "Prepare for production" → Strict TDD/DDD.  

---

### **Phase 4: Implement Feedback Loops**
**Objective**: Let the system learn from user interactions to improve guidance.

#### **Mechanisms**:
1. **Pattern Adoption Rate**  
   - *Metric*: Track how often users accept vs. override architectural suggestions.  
   - *Learning*: If users often ignore `TDD-first` rule, AI adjusts prompting strategy.

2. **Ambiguity Detector**  
   - *What*: Flags vague requirements for clarification.  
   - *Example*:  
     *User*: “Make it scalable” → *AI*: “Define scalability goals:  
     - Concurrent users?  
     - Data volume?  
     - Latency thresholds?”  

---

### **Phase 5: The White Book (Living Documentation)**
**Objective**: Auto-generate a **decision log** that evolves with the project.

#### **Structure**:
1. **Sections**:
   - **Architectural Chronicle**: Versioned pattern changes.  
   - **Requirement Traces**: Links between user stories and code.  
   - **Debt Register**: All temporary compromises.  

2. **Access**:
   - **CLI Command**: `copilot docs open` → Opens markdown in Codespace.  
   - **Auto-Commit**: Changes to `docs/white-book.md` on key decisions.

---

### **Roadmap Summary**
1. **Start with the Librarian** (Phase 1) → Foundation for context.  
2. **Layer in Governance** (Phase 2) → Prevent architectural drift.  
3. **Refine Interaction** (Phase 3) → Balance speed & quality.  
4. **Enable Adaptation** (Phase 4) → AI learns user preferences.  
5. **Document Everything** (Phase 5) → Create institutional memory.
